**Project Title**: Lasso Solution Path with Coordinate Descent Algorithm

**Objective**: To develop a robust implementation that traces the entire solution path of the Lasso regression problem by leveraging the Coordinate Descent algorithm.

**Background**:
The Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression is a popular method in statistics and machine learning for feature selection and regularization. By introducing a penalty on the magnitude of the coefficients, Lasso can drive certain coefficients to be exactly zero, resulting in a sparse model. Understanding the solution path of Lasso, or how the coefficients change as the regularization parameter varies, can provide insights into the underlying structure of the data and the stability of feature selection.

**Conclusion**:
Tracing the Lasso solution path using the Coordinate Descent algorithm can offer a deep understanding of how regularization impacts feature selection. This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool to visualize and analyze these effects, benefiting a wide range of data-driven applications.
